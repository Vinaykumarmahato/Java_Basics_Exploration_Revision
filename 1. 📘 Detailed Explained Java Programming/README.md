  🖥️ Explanation:

  🤖 Our code runs on a CPU, which is a semiconductor device composed of
  🌐 transistors. Transistors are used to control the flow of electricity,
  📊 allowing for the representation of binary states. In digital systems, low
  ⚡ voltage corresponds to binary 0, and high voltage corresponds to binary 1.
  
  ⚙️ Transistors, acting as switches, transition between low and high states.
  📈 While the actual voltage and current values may vary, the focus in digital
  🧠 systems is on the binary representation. As software engineers, we leverage
  🤓 this binary system by representing low and high states as 0 and 1,
  👾 respectively. This binary language forms the foundation of communication
  📡 between hardware and software, allowing the CPU to understand and execute
  🔄 instructions in the form of 0s and 1s.
  
  
  🇮🇳 In Hindi:
  
  🌐 hamara code ek CPU par chalta hai, jo ek semiconductor device hai aur isme
  ⚙️ transistors ka use hota hai. Transistors electricity ka flow control karne
  📊 mein madad karte hain, jisse binary states ko represent kiya ja sake. Digital
  🧠 systems mein, low voltage ko binary 0 ke saath joda jata hai, aur high
  ⚡ voltage ko binary 1 ke saath.
  
  ⚙️ Transistors switches ki tarah kaam karte hain aur low aur high states ke
  📈 beech mein transition karte hain. Haan, asli voltage aur current values alag
  🤓 ho sakti hain, lekin digital systems mein dhyan binary representation par
  📡 hota hai. Hum software engineers ke roop mein is binary system ka upayog
  🔄 karte hain, jisme low aur high states ko 0 aur 1 ke roop mein darshaya jata
  📊 hai. Yeh binary bhasha hardware aur software ke beech ki communication ka
  🌐 mool hai, jisse CPU ko instructions ko 0 aur 1 ke roop mein samajhne aur
  🔄 execute karne mein madad milti hai.
  
  📝 Note:
  the main reason of understanding the cpu only Binary digit 0's and 1's is because it has made by Transistor.
 
public class Hello {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }

}

  
  🌐 Let's talk about programming:
  
  🤖 When we tell the computer what to do, it follows our instructions and gives
  🎯 us results. If we use numbers like "001 100 1010," it's called machine
  🖥️ language, and the computer gets it directly.
  
  🤔 But remembering lots of these codes is hard. That's where Assembly language
  🛠️ comes in. Instead of using numbers, we use words like "add" for adding and
  📉 "sub" for subtracting. It makes things a bit easier for us.
  
  😓 The problem is, the computer still doesn't get it because it only understands
  🔄 0s and 1s. So, we use a special tool called an Assembler to turn our words
  🗣️ into the computer's language.
  
  🛠️ Assembly language is not very easy for us, though. So, we made another
  📝 language called High-level language. It's like talking in sentences and is
  🤓 easier for us to understand.
 
  🤖 But guess what? The computer still doesn't understand. To help, we use a tool
  🛠️ called a Compiler to change our high-level language into the computer's
  🖥️ language.
